shame,My attempt at a relaxing bath was interrupted by a cold shower of reality (and kids). #MomLife
shame,Tried to impress the kids with my dance moves. Now awaiting my dad dancing award. #DadLife
shame,Made coffee without coffee grounds. It’s just that kind of day. #NeedMoreCoffee
shame,Accidentally scared myself with my own shadow. It’s been a long week. #Spooky
shame,Finally got around to that deep clean. Found a Christmas gift from last year still in the bag. #LateToTheParty
